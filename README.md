### 1. Inverse Reinforcement Learning via Convex Optimization") 📈

- **Authors**: Hao Zhu (H-index: 91.0), Yuan Zhang (H-index: 136.0)
- **Published**: 2025-01-27T11:03:18Z
- **Summary**: We consider the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem, where an
unknown reward function of some Markov decision process is estimated based on
observed expert demonstrations. In most existing approaches, IRL is formulated
and solved as a nonconvex optimization problem, posing challenges in scenarios
where robustness and reproducibility are critical. We discuss a convex
formulation of the IRL...

- **Summary**: Constrained optimization is popularly seen in reinforcement learning for
addressing complex control tasks. From the perspective of dynamic system,
iteratively solving a constrained optimization problem can be framed as the
temporal evolution of a feedback control system. Classical constrained
optimization methods, such as penalty and Lagrangian approaches, inherently use
proportional and integral ...

- **Summary**: Benchmarking and establishing proper statistical validation metrics for
reinforcement learning (RL) remain ongoing challenges, where no consensus has
been established yet. The emergence of quantum computing and its potential
applications in quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) further complicate
benchmarking efforts. To enable valid performance comparisons and to streamline

- **Summary**: The average-reward formulation of reinforcement learning (RL) has drawn
increased interest in recent years due to its ability to solve
temporally-extended problems without discounting. Independently, RL algorithms
have benefited from entropy-regularization: an approach used to make the
optimal policy stochastic, thereby more robust to noise. Despite the distinct
benefits of the two approaches, the...

procedures that enable agents to explore without causing harm to themselves or
others. The most successful solutions to the problem of safe RL leverage
offline data to learn a safe-set, enabling safe online exploration. However,
this approach to safe-learning is often constrained by the demonstrations that
are available ...
